# Assignment: Build a Coding Agent

## Overview

Your task is to build a coding agent with a command-line interface (CLI), similar to tools like Claude Code, Cursor CLI, or Gemini CLI.

## Requirements

1. **Build a CLI-based coding agent** that can assist with programming tasks
2. **No agentic frameworks** — do not use LangChain, Strands, CrewAI, or similar frameworks. Use raw LLM API calls only (you may use wrappers like litellm).
3. **LLM choice is open** — use any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local models, etc.)
4. **Implement core agent functionality:**
   - Accept user input via command line
   - Send requests to an LLM API
   - Parse and execute tool calls / function calls
   - Display results to the user
5. **Professional CLI design** — your interface should be clear and polished, similar in style to Claude Code or Cursor Agent (e.g., readable output formatting, clear prompts, visual feedback for operations)

## Deliverables

1. **Your coding agent** — the source code for your CLI agent
2. **A comprehensive README** — document how to install, configure, and use your agent
3. **One interesting program/project built by your agent** — include an example of something non-trivial that your agent constructed

## Submission

This is an **individual** assignment.

Submit via Canvas using one of the following methods:
- **Option A:** Zip your code repository and upload it
- **Option B:** Share a link to a public GitHub repository (if you're comfortable) or add username `barghouthi` to your private repo.
